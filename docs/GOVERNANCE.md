# Governance and Appeals Process for OpenBayanMesh-Edge

This document outlines the governance structure for the OpenBayanMesh-Edge project, including the process for resolving disputes, handling appeals, and ensuring fair and transparent decision-making within the community.

## 1. Project Governance Structure

OpenBayanMesh-Edge is a volunteer-driven, open-source project. Governance is primarily managed by a group of designated **Maintainers** who are responsible for:

-   Maintaining the codebase and documentation.
-   Reviewing and merging Pull Requests.
-   Enforcing the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
-   Making decisions regarding node compliance and operational status.
-   Mediating disputes and handling appeals.

Decisions are made through consensus among Maintainers, with transparency and community input as guiding principles.

## 2. Code of Conduct Enforcement

Violations of the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) are handled according to the enforcement guidelines detailed within that document. The process involves:

1.  **Reporting:** Unacceptable behavior should be reported to the Maintainers as outlined in the Code of Conduct.
2.  **Review and Investigation:** Maintainers will promptly and fairly review and investigate all complaints.
3.  **Corrective Action:** Maintainers will determine and apply appropriate corrective actions, ranging from warnings to temporary or permanent bans, based on the severity and impact of the violation.

## 3. Node Compliance and Operational Status Disputes

OpenBayanMesh-Edge relies on the operational integrity and compliance of individual nodes. Disputes may arise concerning a node's registration, health status, or adherence to security and privacy policies.

### Reasons for Non-Compliance or Removal:

-   **Unhealthy Status:** Persistent failure of `/health` checks.
-   **Non-Compliance:** Failure to meet minimum hardware/software prerequisites or configuration requirements.
-   **Security Policy Violation:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, data, or other security breaches.
-   **Privacy Policy Violation:** Collection or transmission of PII, or other breaches of privacy standards.
-   **Code of Conduct Violation:** Actions by the node operator that violate the community's Code of Conduct.

### Process for Handling Non-Compliance:

1.  **Notification:** If a node is identified as non-compliant or unhealthy, Maintainers will attempt to notify the node owner via registered contact information, detailing the issue and required remediation steps.
2.  **Grace Period:** A reasonable grace period will be provided for the node owner to address and remediate the identified issues.
3.  **Removal from Mesh:** If remediation is not completed within the grace period, or if the violation is critical, the edge node's public endpoint shall be removed from the mesh registry and load balancer.

## 4. Appeals and Resolution Process

Node operators who believe a decision regarding their node's compliance, operational status, or any enforcement action is unjust or incorrect have the right to appeal.

### How to Appeal:

1.  **Submit a Formal Appeal:** Appeals must be submitted in writing to the Maintainers via [governance@openbayanmesh.org](mailto:governance@openbayanmesh.org) (replace with actual email) within 14 days of the decision.
2.  **Include Details:** The appeal should clearly state:
    -   The decision being appealed.
    -   The reasons for the appeal, including any new information or context.
    -   Desired outcome.
3.  **Evidence:** Provide any supporting evidence or documentation relevant to your appeal.

### Appeal Review Process:

1.  **Acknowledgement:** Maintainers will acknowledge receipt of the appeal within 3 business days.
2.  **Review Committee:** A subset of Maintainers (excluding any directly involved in the initial decision) will form an ad-hoc review committee.
3.  **Investigation:** The review committee will investigate the appeal, which may include:
    -   Reviewing all relevant documentation and logs.
    -   Consulting with parties involved in the original decision.
    -   Requesting additional information from the appealing party.
4.  **Decision:** The review committee will make a decision based on the evidence and project policies. This decision will be communicated to the appealing party within 14 business days of the appeal's submission (or longer if further investigation is required, with notification to the appealing party).
5.  **Finality:** The decision of the appeal review committee is final.

## 5. Constructive Feedback and Community Input

OpenBayanMesh-Edge encourages constructive feedback, learning, and knowledge sharing among contributors. While formal appeals are for disputes, general feedback and suggestions can be provided via:

-   [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/your-org/OpenBayanMesh-Edge/issues)
-   [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/your-org/OpenBayanMesh-Edge/discussions)

This process ensures that all participants have a voice and that decisions are made fairly and transparently, fostering a healthy and collaborative community.
